## Discussion Points:

### The scope of the project in comparison to the scope of our concepts. 

* The idea of crewmates that have mechanical influence on the game may be too ambitious for the time and resources we have.
* TensorFlow may be too time-expensive as well.
* We discussed alternative mechanical resources for the player to gather as well as other ways to implement story, without immense focus on crewmates.
* We discussed alternative methods of "randomly" generating backgrounds and other sprites.

### Began discussing sprites:

* Discussed what we need sprites for.
* Started looking at examples of sprites that we could use.

## Goals for Next Week:

* Wait for Professor feedback on proposal and make adjustments based on that.
* Know how to use Godot (on at least a basic level).
* Start outlining the first prototype of the game.
