## Discussion Points:

### Title Scene

Evan worked on building a basic title screen. He:

* Added a basic, place-holder, logo to the Title Scene
* Worked on a "new game" button for the Title Scene
* Worked on a label that displays the title of the game

### Main Scene

Max worked with Godot in order to figure out elements of the engine needed to form the main scene. He:

* Getting a basic feel for tile maps
* Working on how to use labels to display information (useful for the item and stat lists for the main scene)

## Goals for Next Week:

* Each team member will come to the meeting with some prototype of the main scene.
   * Working on designing these prototypes should help each group member get a better hold of Godot in the context of our project.
* Share our newfound knowledge of Godot with fellow team members and make sure everyone is on the same page going forward.
* Have an actual, working main scene up and running.
* Divide the work for main scene's child scenes among team members.
* Begin working on separate child scenes.
