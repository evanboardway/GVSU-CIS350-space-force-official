## Discussion points: 

### Big Picture

* Planetary Exploration options:
   * __Tiles maps and moving around the planet__
   * Text based events
* End Case options:
   * Complete tasks to destroy the Earth
   * Shoot lasers at the Earth

### Lasers

* Laser physics don't work as well as they should right now
   * Lasers collide with player and lasers collide with each other
   * Lasers don't do anything to enemy ships
* Options for the lasers
   * Fix the physics
   * Change the lasers (to something like a shock wave)

### Enemy NPCs

* If there are >10 enemies in the scene, the game crashes
* Options for fixing this issue:
   * Memory opimization
   * Enemy respawning after set time period
* Enemy difficulty
   * Higher levels of weapons required to deal damage to higher levels of enemies (scaled shields)
   * Higher levels of shields needed to take hits from higher level enemies (scaled weapons)

## Goals for next week

* Work on laser physics and mechanics
* Polish up some details with current working project
* Work on ship upgrades
* Work on tile maps
