## Discussion Points:

### Prototype Main Scenes

* Max presented his main scene, which included a moving sprite with a list of non-dynamic stats and resources that follow the sprite as they move.
* Ryan presented his main scene, which included a sprite on a tile map whose movement patterns and controls are similar to what we're aiming for in our final prototype.

### Dynamic Values

* We researched, discussed, and tested methods of implementing dynamic values
   * These values should be updated in code whenever applicable
   * These updated values should be displayed to the user after being updated
   * These values should hold the same value no matter where they are displayed (main scene, system scene, etc)
* Used the stats_manager.gd class built into the Godot engine
   * This allowed every instance of a stat to hold the same value
