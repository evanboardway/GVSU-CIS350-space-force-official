# Space Force Official

Project description (~1 paragraph)

Elevator Pitch: Our project plan is to create a rouguelike rpg set in an sci-fi environment revolving around turn based combat, story elements and procedurally generated maps.

Feature 1: Procedurally generated maps. Each time you play the game, the map and all of its systems(smaller maps inside)will be randomized so no playthrough is the same. 
The maps contain randomized NPCs, planets, merchants, prices for merchants and the people you can recruit will all be procedurally generated each playthrough to incentivize 
strategy and repeated playthroughs.
Feature 2: Turn based combat. Combat will revolve around hidden and known stats that interact with each other throughout the game. Common stats such as health, attack, shield 
and speed will be shown for yourself. The enemies stats (attack, shield, speed) will be hidden during combat. Combat will be upgraded based on items from merchants, upgrades 
to your ship and crew member multipliers.
Process/Plan: We are planning on doing a modified agile approach, treating each other as customers. We'll check in on a weekly basis with progress reports on what we've done 
and discuss what the other group members think of it. Changes will stay/be removed based on feedback from the "customer", or the vote of the group. We plan on dividing work 
evenly while trying to favor each others strengths.
