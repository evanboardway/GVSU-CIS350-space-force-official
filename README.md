# Space Force Official

Project description (~1 paragraph)

Our project plan is to create a rouguelike rpg set in an sci-fi environment revolving around turn based combat, story elements and procedurally generated maps. We'll have checkpoints and consistent story elements to keep the player interested while still designing aspects of the game to incentivize replayabilty. The general plot is that the main character is a pirate who escapes Earth and aquires a spaceship. He then sets out to upgrade the spaceship, with the goal of ruling or destroying Earth.
