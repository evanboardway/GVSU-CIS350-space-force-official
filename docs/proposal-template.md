# Introduction


Our project plan is to create a rouguelike rpg set in an sci-fi environment revolving around turn based combat, story elements and procedurally generated maps.
The plot outline we've concieved so far is the player controlled character is a pirate escaping Earth. They begin the game with a spaceship and make their way around the galaxy
with the goal of exploring worlds and systems, seeking to upgrade their ship. The player controlled character will be able to interact and meet different NPC's around the 
systems, some random and some fixed. We are planning on creating story elements through the backstories and relationships of the NPC's found, as well as certian checkpoints in the game to help keep the player on track. The player will have a set amount of 
turns to finish their quest for upgrades before they will have to attack Earth, with the main goal being to subjigate or destroy Earth. 


The gameplay will revolve around the player moving around systems and exploring them. They'll have the opportunity to stop at planets, visit upgrade stations/space gas stations, and fight enemies. Depending on our 
timetable and how development goes, we've discussed implementing more complex systems featuring asteroids, comets,  and random merchants. The systems will be randomly 
generated with the hope that no two playthroughs are the same. The player will upgrade their ship through a combination of materials that'll give static boosts to certian aspects 
of their ship, and NPC's that'll give multipliers to their ship. Combat will be turn based, revolving around a simple statline including attack, defense, health, and speed. If development 
allows, we've discussed adding more than one type of attack stat. 


The replayability aspect is gained through the time limit. The player will be forced to make decisions based on materials they have, NPC's they've found, and remaining fuel. While certian story elements will remain consistent in the form of checkpoints, not all of
the map will be able to be explored during each playthrough and not all of the NPC's will be able to be found in one playthrough. Our hope is that this will entice the player 
to return and continue to attempt to take different routes while still finding enough upgrades and being able to successfully beat the final boss at the end(Earth). Our plan 
is also to have some of the better materials generated more frequently closer to Earth, giving the player high-risk high-reward scenario. 


# Anticipated Technologies

* GODOT(in Python)
* TensorFlow(if time permits)
* Array of random images in case TensorFlow doesn't work out
* GitHub


We are planning on using GODOT game engine as our base tool and scripting in Python. We are planning on using TensorFlow(if time permits) to procedurally generate different sprites for the map backgrounds.  
If time doesn't allow TensorFlow, we'll be using an array of random images. We'll be using Github to host and share our files.


# Method/Approach


We are planning on doing a modified agile approach, treating each other as customers. We'll check in on a weekly basis with progress reports on what we've done and discuss what the other group members think of it.
Changes will stay/be removed based on feedback from the "customer", or the vote of the group. We plan on dividing work evenly while trying to favor each others strengths


# Estimated Timeline


Our timeline has been consistently changing and is the part of the project we are the most unsure about. Our top priority is to keep consistent communication between team members and adjust our goals as time permits.
Some major milestones we have considered are:


* Creating a functional player controlled character
* Functioning AI's
* Functional map/background generation
* Our biggest milestone we've planned out to is creating a working
prototype.


# Anticipated Problems

* Time constraints could be a problem. None of the team members have ever built a game like this, and we are unaware of how long it will actually take. Many of our ideas may not be implemented due to a lack of time.
* Godot is a new technology that will take time to learn for all team members. This could hinder the time to get the project off the ground. 
* Game balance could be difficult as it will be difficult to test unless a prototype is up and running fairly quickly. 
* Finding unique sprites for characters also may pose a challenge, as none of the team members have any experience in art or design in terms of sprites.
