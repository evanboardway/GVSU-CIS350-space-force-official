text = "	Use the WAD keys to move and navigate the vastness of space. Whenever you move or jump star systems, you'll consume fuel. 
Be careful not to run out, there is nobody to help you if you become stranded!

	Since you were just thrown out of the Earth, you'll begin in the earth system. Warp to other systems using a trade station and travel planet-side to gather resources - iron, silver, and gold are in high demand.

	You can trade resources you mine at trade stations for coin. Coins will be used to maintain and upgrade your ship - you'll have that hunk of junk in fighting shape in no time. 
	
	A little extra coin and you may find yourself with some hired help - fellow pirates and unsavory folks willing to help you knock the Earth down a peg. Be weary, the more skilled the pirate, the more coin they'll demand. New crew will be found at each system, with each crew member giving a bonus to one of you rcore stats. 

	Your ship comes equipped with guided missiles that you can fire by right-clicking. The missiles travel to the coordinates you designate, detonating if they hit a surface.

	Your onboard navigation will help you keep your bearings. Whenever you enter a system,your nav will designate the systems
 trade station as (0,0), and will display your current coordinates. Because you originated from the Earth, when inside the earth system the Earth itself will belocated at (0,0).

	Be wary as you travel, the Space Force monitors many of the systems near earth - you're a notorious criminal now, so they'll attack on sight. The Earth System itself is teeming with patrols. You'll have to get stronger if you want to get your revenge...
